# EARTHQUAKE MAP

Showing a active map of New Zealand, with real-time earthquake data. Showing the last 100 earthquakes, and their magnatude. The map is static, and the earthquake magnatudes are highlighted by showing different colours and sizes.


## What I learned

* Using PS5.js to interface with external API, combined with JS.
* Map projections.
* Conversation of longitude, latitude to x, y coordinates.
* Integration between map images, ps5.js, external data, and javascript.
